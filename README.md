Hello,

A few notes:
* /city/id can accept either the numeric ID, but it can accept the city name too.
	 * It may have trouble if same-named cities are introduced.
* I think the css and page layout need work.
* The app.js file could be split into separate module files.
* Unit tests and specs would be in the module.
* Couldn't figure out what the /authors resource did.
