<p>Hello!

<p>Here's an API call that returns a list of all places with photos</p>

<a href='http://mqlocal.aol.com/photos'>http://mqlocal.aol.com/photos</a>

<p>To get photos for a place add the place ID to the API call like so

<a href='http://mqlocal.aol.com/photos/282039223'>http://mqlocal.aol.com/photos/282039223</a>

<p>(If neither of the links work for you, use the provided sample files.) </p>

<p>Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to build a single page application using AngularJS meeting the following requirements:</p>

<ul>
	<li>The home page should display the list of the cities by name. The data should come from the first API call.
	<li>Clicking a city name should display that city's photo thumbnails and captions. That data should come from the second API call. 
  <li>A user should be able to use a URL to navigate to the city list view or to the photo list view. 
</ul>

<p>Please place the final project in a publicly available location on GitHub. you can use index.html as a starting point.</p>
